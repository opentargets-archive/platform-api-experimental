Depending on the organism, the CV complex (CVC) shows different degrees of specialization of its tubular and vesicular elements. In the most elaborate CVCs of certain ciliates, e.g. Paramecium, a central vacuole, the contractile vacuole or cisterna, is surrounded by radially oriented ampullae or radial arms. These ampullae are connected to a network of channels. Excess cytosolic water, acquired osmotically, is segregated by the radial arms and enters the vacuole, so that the vacuole swells (the fluid-filling phase). The vacuole then rounds (the rounding phase) and the radial arms sever from the vacuole. The vacuole membrane then fuses with the plasma membrane at the pore region and the pore opens. The vacuole shrinks as its fluid is discharged through the pore (the fluid-discharging phase). The pore closes when the fluid has been discharged.

The inflammasome assembly leads to the activation of proinflammatory procaspases, hence is usually involved in innate immunity and inflammation. The core of inflammasomes consists of at least 2 components: a signal sensor and an effector inflammatory caspase (mostly CASP1). However, most inflammasomes contain a third element, an adaptor (often ASC/PYCARD). The interaction between the sensor component and the adaptor initiates speck formation (nucleation) which greatly enhances further addition of soluble adaptor molecules to the speck in a prion-like polymerization process. The kinetic properties of the adaptor aggregation have been shown to generate a rapid 'all-or-none' response, this is why only one speck by cell is observed.",

This alternative transport of pigment allows the animal to effect color changes important for camouflage and social interactions. Melanophores transport their pigment in response to extracellular cues: neurotransmitters in the case of fish and hormonal stimuli in the case of frogs. In both cases, melanosome dispersion is induced by elevation of intracellular cAMP levels, while aggregation is triggered by depression of cAMP. The regulatory mechanisms downstream of these second-messengers are poorly understood.

Speckles appear, at the immunofluorescence-microscope level, as irregular, punctuate structures, which vary in size and shape. Usually 25-50 speckles are observed per interphase mammalian nucleus. At the electronic-microscope level, they are composed of heterogeneous mixture of electro-dense particles with diameters ranging from 20-25 nm and are called interchromatin granules clusters (IGCs). Speckles are dynamic structures. Both their protein and RNA-protein components can cycle continuously between speckles and other nuclear locations depending on the transcriptional state of the cell. Structures similar to nuclear speckles have been identified in the amphibian oocyte nucleus (called B snurposomes) and in Drosophila melanogaster embryos, but not in yeast.",

In chloroplast, thylakoids stack up to form the grana or stay as single cisternae and interconnect the grana. Thylakoid, where photosynthesis occurs, are found in chloroplasts, cyanelles and in photosynthetic bacteria where they are the extensive invaginations of the plasma membrane.",

    "description": "The tight junction (TJ) is a dynamic, multifunctional complex which, together with adherens junctions and desmosomes, maintains the integrity of the epithelial cell layer(s) that protects multicellular organisms. TJ is located at the apical-most portion of the intercellular junction. It separates the apical and basolateral compartments of epithelia (preventing the lateral diffusion of lipids and proteins between the apical and basolateral domains of plasma membrane) and plays a key role in limiting paracellular permeability to ions and solutes in a charge and size selective manner. TJs appear as multiple strands of fibrils forming a continuous circumferential seal around cells.",
